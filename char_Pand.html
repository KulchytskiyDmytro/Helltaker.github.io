                                <p>Pandemonica, like most of the Helltaker cast, is depicted as a short demon girl with pale skin, red irises, a black arrow-tipped tail, and silvery-white hair. Her hair is wavy and fashioned in 3 large curls resting on her
                                    forehead, with the middle curl being larger than the two on either side. It reaches down both sides of her head, tucked behind her ears, with both ends curling inwards at the bottom of her head close to her chin.
                                </p>
                                <p> Additionally, she has a pony tail on the back of her head with two more large, distinctive curls. Poking out of her hair are two small black horns that are rounded at the tips. She has white eyebrows and has visible dark
                                    circles under her rounded eyes, giving her a tired appearance as her alias would suggest. </p>
