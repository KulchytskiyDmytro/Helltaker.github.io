                                <p>Justice, like most of the Helltaker cast, is depicted as a short demon girl with pale skin, a black arrow-tipped tail, and silvery-white hair. Her irises are grey as she is blind, which can be seen in the epilogue. She
                                    has a short pony tail on the back of her head, tighten with a red bandana. Poking out of her hair are two small black horns that are rounded at the tips. She has white eyebrows and wears sunglasses, masking her blindness.
                                </p>
                                <p>Justice has a black tie with two silver clips attaching it to her red shirt. She wears a black suit jacket, which she wears, unbuttoned, around her shoulders. She sports red fingerless gloves, gifted to her by Lucifer,
                                    with metal tags on the wrists, labelled "HPJ", which likely stands for "High Prosecutor Justice." She wears black pants with a belt and boots like the rest of the demons.</p>
