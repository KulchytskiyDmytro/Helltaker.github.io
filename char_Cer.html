                                <p>Cerberus, like most of the Helltaker cast, is depicted as a short demon girl with pale skin, red irises, a black arrow-tipped tail, and silvery-white hair; however, in her case, she is represented as 3 girls rather than
                                    1, although these traits still apply to all three. Since all three are identical, any descriptors applied to one of the girls apply to all of them.
                                </p>
                                <p>While not possessing horns like the rest of the demons, they instead have white canine ears that emerge from under their hair on the top of their heads; They also all have canine teeth, as evidenced by the small fangs present
                                    in their mouths in their idle sprite. Their eyes are very large, rounded, and wide, invoking an enthusiastic expression. They have parted fringes and their hair stretches all the way down their back, where at the end
                                    it is tied via hair tie into a short "tail".</p>
